# DNDdiceGenerator

This Dungeons and Dragons dice roller utilizes a free client provided by the website `RANDOM.org`, which claims to use atmospheric noise for number generation. The code also gives users the option for users to roll with `Advantage` or `Disadvantage`.

There are three ways of rolling a 20-sided dice, commonly called a `D20`. The first type is a standard roll, where the number you land on is your roll. The second type is Advantage, where you roll a D20 twice and the higher number between the two is your roll. The third is Disadvantage, where you roll a D20 twice and the lower number is your roll.
